<p>Galactic winds, or galaxy-scale outflows of gas, not only shape many observable properties of the galaxy population but also play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe. They are ubiquitously detected in multi-wavelength observations over cosmic time and found driven by different physical sources, such as the core-collapse supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and cosmic rays.</p>

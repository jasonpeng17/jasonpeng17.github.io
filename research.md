## [Probing the Dynamics and Metal Content of Galactic Winds Through Absorption and Emission Lines](esi_galactic_wind.html) {#esi_galactic_wind}
Galactic winds, or galaxy-scale outflows of gas, not only shape many observable properties of the galaxy population but also play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe. They are ubiquitously detected in multi-wavelength observations over cosmic time and found driven by different physical sources, such as the core-collapse supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and cosmic rays. Theorists found cosmological models would overproduce stellar mass and star formation rates (SFR) from comic noon to the present without proper treatment of galactic winds. Through these simulations, galactic winds also determine the overall shape and amplitude of the relations between galaxies' observable properties, such as the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and regulate the escape of Lyman continuum photons......

## [Using KCWI to Explore the Chemical Inhomogeneities and Evolution of an Extreme-Emission-Line Galaxy](kcwi_1044.html) {#kcwi_1044} 
J1044+0353 is considered a local analog of the young galaxies that ionized the intergalactic medium at high-redshift due to its low mass, low metallicity, high specific star formation rate, and strong high-ionization emission lines......

<p>Zixuan received her Physics B.S. with a minor in Astronomy from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2021. He is interested in the interface between theoretical and observational work in galaxy formation and evolution. His current work is mainly about the chemical evolution of Extreme-Emission-Line Galaxies, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization, and galactic wind.</p>

<p>Since 5th grade in elementary school, I have started to practice basketball with the school’s basketball team. I always loved the feeling to handle ball and organize the whole team. It was the main reason that I chose to become a point guard on the court. I never satisfied with my skills, including shooting, passing, defensing, and dribbling, and attempted to find appropriate instructions available online. I also obsessed with competing against players that are better than me (no matter technically or physically). This attitude/personality definitely helps me make progress every year. Basketball not only made me become a better athelete with a tougher mentality and a stronger body, but it also gave me many valuable opportunities to make true, genuine friends. Even though both of my knees have to be suffered from the ACL surgeries (got injured in basketball matches), basketball helped me develop into a more optimistic person. Through these injuries, the most important point I learn is to respect the reality and always push myself to the limit. Even if the result is not satisfactory, the journey is already fasinating enough. Just like Romain Roland said: “There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it.” Please click the <a href="ballislife.html">link</a> if you want to know more about my basketball journey.</p>

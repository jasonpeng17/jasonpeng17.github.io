# Research Summary

## [Physical Origins of Outflowing Cold Clouds in Local Star-forming Galaxies](esi_galactic_wind.html) {#esi_galactic_wind}
We study the physical origins of outflowing cold clouds in a sample of 14 low-redshift galaxies from the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) using Keck/ESI data. Outflows are traced by broad (FWHM ~ 260 km/s) and very-broad (VB; FWHM ~ 1000 km/s) velocity components in strong emission lines like [OIII] 5007 and H-alpha......

## [Resolving the Mechanical and Radiative Feedback in an Extreme-Emission-Line Dwarf Galaxy](kcwi_1044_clm_zp.html) {#kcwi_1044_clm_zp} 
We present integral field spectroscopy toward and around J1044+0353, a rapidly growing, low-metallicity galaxy that produces extreme [O III] line emission. A new map of the O32 flux ratio reveals a density-bounded ionization cone emerging from the starburst......

## [Using KCWI to Explore the Chemical Inhomogeneities and Evolution of an Extreme-Emission-Line Galaxy](kcwi_1044.html) {#kcwi_1044} 
J1044+0353 is considered a local analog of the young galaxies that ionized the intergalactic medium at high-redshift due to its low mass, low metallicity, high specific star formation rate, and strong high-ionization emission lines......
